# Random_Forest
Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both Classification(like heart_prediction.csv) and Regression(car_data.csv) problems in ML. It is based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.
