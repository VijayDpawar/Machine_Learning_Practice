# XGBoost
XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework optimized gradient boosting algorithm through parallel processing ,tree pruning, handling missing values and regularization to avoid overfittting or bias. In this algorithm we build a model on boston inbuild dataset.
