# Support_Vector_machine
Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification(mouse_viral_study.csv) and regression(wine_fraud.csv). Though we say regression problems as well its best suited for classification. The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.
